# Project Lifecycle

Brief -> Wireframe -> Color Palette

## Brief

A description of the project. Contains logos, text, colors, information on the client and his clients.

## Wireframe

A very basic design on the website. Usually doesn't contain style elements like text alignment, images, colors, fonts...

## Color Palette

Primary Color -> Secondary Color -> Gradient -> Neutrals -> Contextual

### Primary:

Start with a single color (might be clients choice or something with existing assets, or color psychology)
Go to adobe color. Pick a harmony and use the chosen colors.
Have a Page called "Assets" in Figma. Store the colors in circles, and use "styles" feature to call colors "primary" etc.
Create a gradient if you need to.

### Neutrals:

Don't use pure black, even for text. Just use very dark gray.
You can use your primary color and mix it with gray.
Then make the same color, but 75%, 50%, 25%, 10% and 5%. Call them Black 100, Black 75...

### Contextual:

Aka an error color. Usually some kind of red.
