Shade is creaated by adding black to a color.
Tone is created by adding gray to a color.

RGB - red, green blue. Designed for computers.
CMYK - cyan, magenta, yellow, black. Designed for print.
HSV / HSB - Hue, Saturation, Value / Brightness. Easier to read by humans.
Hex - #12AE34 - most convenient for coding.

# Project Lifecycle

Brief -> Wireframe -> Color Palette -> Typography -> Spacing and Sizing -> Icons and Images -> Design!

## Brief

A description of the project. Contains logos, text, colors, information on the client and his clients.

## Wireframe

A very basic design on the website. Usually doesn't contain style elements like text alignment, images, colors, fonts...

## Color Palette

Primary Color -> Secondary Color -> Gradient -> Neutrals -> Contextual

### Primary:

Start with a single color (might be clients choice or something with existing assets, or color psychology)
Go to adobe color. Pick a harmony and use the chosen colors.
Have a Page called "Assets" in Figma. Store the colors in circles, and use "styles" feature to call colors "primary" etc.
Create a gradient if you need to.

### Neutrals:

Don't use pure black, even for text. Just use very dark gray.
You can use your primary color and mix it with gray.
Then make the same color, but 75%, 50%, 25%, 10% and 5%. Call them Black 100, Black 75...

### Contextual:

Aka an error color. Usually some kind of red.

## Typograhy

Possibly the most important part.

Where to get fonts?
Find:
The best places are google fonts (good and free) and adobe fonts (better but paid).
or buy:
For example Envato.

Understand your brand and audience.
Luxury: Serif font
Tech: Sans Serif - modern and trustworthy.

Important things:
readability
loading time

They have roles and attributes.
Roles:
headings
paragraphs

Attributes:
weight, size, line height

Use typescales.
Font pairings / combinations.

Make a new screen in assets page, called typography.
Make following elements with example values:
paragraph - 21px, line-height: 30, black 75
heading 1, 2, 3... - values from typeface, bold

Headings are usually bold, but it's a nice accent to make heading 3 light.
You can create text styles for them.

## Spacing and Sizing

Creates whitespace.
Dictates visual hierarchy.

8 point system - use multiples of 8 for every size.
For example, button with vertical padding of 8px and horizontal padding of 32px.

You can use 12 column system too
Or guides (aka ruler)

## Icons

Icons have to be meaningful.
For example: send message and paper plane.
Or standalone icons, like social media.

They need a consistent style:

- outline
- solid
- duotone

### Collections

FontAwesome
HeroIcons
Ionic
Forge Icons
Bootstrap Icons
Envato Elements

Tool for organizing icons:
Iconset

## Images

Try not to use stock photos. Real pictures will help more if possible.

# Website Patterns

Those are just general guidelines. You can change them as long as the website looks good and is useful.

## Header

Usually the top section of the page that contains:

- logo
- navigation menu
- call to action
- search form?

## Hero

Area next to, or just under the header. It's considered prime real estate, because it's above the fold.
Critical information, call to action.
Often contains a slider.

## Buttons

They can either be used for features or navigation.
You can have multiple styles. Text, icon, both.
Be explicit in wording.
Consider different states:

- default
- mouse over
- active
- disabled

Usually it's good to have 2 styles of buttons, one more accentuated.

## Image Gallery

Displaying a collection of images, allowing to see several items at once.
Useful for shops too (multiple angles, variations).
Slideshows.
Lightboxes.
For the background of an image, you can use a color from the image itself.
